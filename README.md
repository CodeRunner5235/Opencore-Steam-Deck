# Opencore-Steam-Deck
An opencore EFI configuration for the Steam Deck

Catalina is known working with older Steam Deck BIOS versions. MacOS 11.3+ has usb issues that break booting, and newer Steam Deck BIOS verions have the same issue.

Not doing a whole lot of things work on this right now, college is taking a lot of my time. If you find any ways to fix or improve things, feel free to let me know and help out.
